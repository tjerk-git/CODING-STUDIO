# INTRODUCTION

**Coding studio has a focus on web and app development. We have a close relationship with the UX/UI studio, our aim is to fix the world by creating small with scalable and durable and human centered projects.**

The first 10 weeks are about a single shared project in duo or solo setup.
The second 10 weeks are about a team project shared with UX/UI and Coding studio

# RULES

1. Have fun
2. Have a good sense of humor
3. Have a good attitude
4. Help each other

# OUR PROMISE TO YOU

- You can kickstart your development career or own idea’s.
- We will always have agency over the stuff we build.
- We deliver, we make stuff that works, we will take the time needed to iterate and make it work.
- We love experimenting with the cutting edge.

We are mainly focusing on web / app development  mainly because it’s a great place to start your coding adventure. We are not a software engineering minor or a degree, we are part of a design school not the IT department.


# ESCAPE ROOM PROJECT
In 10 weeks we will build a escape room experience.
The escape room experience will be a fun and interactive way to learn to code.

The main infrastructure will be provided by Coding studio.
And each "team" can create puzzles to be played inside the escape room.
The escape room is a place where you will be able to experiment with code, learn to code, create a project and get feedback from a team of experts.


# PLANNING OF THE ESCAPE ROOM PROJECT

- Start developing key puzzle mechanics

### Week 6: Integration
- Connect all components
- Implement MQTT communication
- Create complete game walkthrough
- Begin testing basic functionality

### Week 7: Testing & Refinement

# ADAPTERS FOR THE LEARNING OUTCOMES

These are the adapters for the create learning outcome.
For other adapters talk to you mentor.

## Coding level 1

- You code in such a way that elements are reused when this is appropriate. (DRY)
- You have structured the code in such a way that there is a seperation between layout and style.
- You have verified the code quality and style with a validator service.
- The complexity of the design is of the same level of nos.nl.
- You are able to translate a functional page design into code of layout language like HTML.

## Coding level 2

- You design the structure of the technical solution.
- You develop the architecture of the solution
- You can show the relation between these technical decisions and the interactive design
- You design the structure of the database
- This design is made in such a way that data is saved only once
- You make informed decisions about the tradeoff between the privacy of the user and the data need of your application.
- You implement strategies to guard privacy by minimizing, seperating, abstracting and hiding data.
- You use standard libraries to show content.
- You use repeating, conditionals and personalisation
- You prevent the duplication of code (DRY)
- You create working, reliable, resilient and maintainable webpages of which the important technical decisions are documented.
- Your code is documented is a concise manner
- Your code adheres to code conventions that are appropriate for the language you are using
- You use data hiding concepts, like properties to regulate access to the internal state of a class

## Coding level 3

You develop you programs in an incremental way.

- You write automated tests for the core solutions within your program
- You develop levels of abstraction in your technical design to decrease complexity of individual classes. You might do this to help novel programmers in your team.
- The technical design shows that you use classes to delegate responsibility
- You make informed decisions on what happens on the client and what happens on the server. Based on requirements like speed, ease of use or system integrity
- You choose the right moments for communication between the systems
- You choose how communication will take place based on requirements like: user experience, safety, privacy and efficiency.
- You create a framework that can be used in a new context
- You distribute the framework in a way that is appropriate for the programming environment that is used
